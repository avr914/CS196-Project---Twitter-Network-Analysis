|| December 4th Update/Brainstorm ||
-Finding most rate-limit evasive way to scrape twitter
-use user properties to take json of all of major account_followers
-2 calls - 1 for user props, 1 for user.followers_ids
-user_lookup for results - cost is 2 calls per usr - on order of 2*40000 calls

Notes on Community Detection Algorithms:
- Label propagation - works quickly (linear time) - completed
	- type: density
	- Warning - not compatible with directed graphs
	- solution: adapt input data/processing so that connected nodes follow each other, thereby making a undirected graph
- Newman-Girvan community detection - works slowly (n^3 polynomial time) - in-progress
	- type: link centrality
	- compatible with directed graphs
	- compatible with multiple components
	- fall-back if not completed: igraph implementation
- Map equation - decent runtime (n) - to do
	- type: compression
	- compatible with directed graphs, weighted graphs

- Let's compare results of three approaches and analyze networks



|| December 2nd Update ||
- Snowball Sample - Follower - Done
- Snowball Sample - Friend - In-Progress
- UIUC Sample - In-Progress
- Label Propagation - Beta Completed
- Examine process_graph.py for quality of output - ToDoLaterTonight (in-progress soon)
- Major To DOs:
	- Decide on analytics on detected communities
	- Look into [paper] twitter_specific_community_detection.pdf
	- Produce graphs for final frontend
	- Modify visualization for communities
	- Implement Wakita-Tsurumi, Clauset-Newman-Moore, or Newman-Girvan algorithm and COMPARE results with Label Propagation
	- Test label propagation method against well-known data sets
	- Examine community metrics - conductance, clustering coefficient, idea tree, interaction sentiment
	- Examine means of detecting friends on twitter - user.followers(), user.friends(), replies, retweets, favorites, mentions[*]
	- Examine using graph-trimming to produce a clearer graph of only key friends

|| December 1st Update ||
- Scrape twitter for network of UIUC-related or UIUC attending twitter accounts
- Assemble this data into a network data structure
- Perform a community detection analysis using label propagation
-
