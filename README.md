# CS196-Project---Twitter-Network-Analysis
WORK IN PROGRESS

-To CS 196 Course Staff: I wasn't sure what to include, so I included everything, except for website files. If necessary, I will ask Ai to add them, and edit/update the README approriately.

Quick Notes:
-Most of the code I wrote is in the community detection folder
-The folder labeled infomap is the program we used from the mapequation website. If necessary, I will add a text file enumerating and explaining all my usages of the map equation program.
-Much of the code was not explicitly designed for use by other users or for release of any sort; the project was more of a discovery project to see what kind of interesting things we could accomplish or discover, ie. that Naren is very active with other ACM users on twitter, or that the ACM twitter user community is mostly made up of student accounts, and official Illinois group or club-based accounts.
-The label propagation algorithm in the zachary's karate club folder was entirely implemented by us based off the corresponding research paper in the research folder
-While we read many of the papers in the research folder, only a few were explicity drawn from in the final project, ie. the map equation paper, the label propagation paper, and the sentiment analysis via sentiment dictionary paper (aka the AFINN project)
